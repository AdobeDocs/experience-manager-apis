If the AEM cloud environment were to restart after the download but before the event were sent or if the event infrastructure were to be temporarily unavailable, the user's download would complete but the event would not be sent.\nThis was a conscious decision made when designing our event capabilities as it allows us to ensure higher performance and reliability of core AEM features, albeit at the cost of not ensuring 100% accuracy in the events that are generated.
